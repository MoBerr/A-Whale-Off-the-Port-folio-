# A-Whale-Off-the-Port-folio-
We have been presented with a series of Stock portfolios data to showcase the different python, pandas and numpy tools combined with a couple of the main analysis ratios and graphs.
After doing the initial comparaison we chose a combination of stocks to build a custom portfolio that can be compared the the algorithmic portfolios and some well known portfolios from the stock market.
By the end of the exercice I was able to apply the analysis and confirm the performance result of my own portfolio, but due to the stocks chosen the portfolio performed badly and realised a loss over the sample period.
